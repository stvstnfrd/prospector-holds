520    "Shot outside Pittsburgh on a shoestring budget by a band 
       of filmmakers determined to make their mark, Night of the 
       Living Dead, directed by horror master George A. Romero, 
       is a great story of independent cinema: a midnight hit 
       turned box-office smash that became one of the most 
       influential films of all time. A deceptively simple tale 
       of a group of strangers trapped in a farmhouse who find 
       themselves fending off a horde of recently dead, flesh-
       eating ghouls, Romero's vision of a late-1960s America 
       literally tearing itself apart rewrote the rules of the 
       horror genre, combined gruesome gore with acute social 
       commentary, and quietly broke ground by casting a black 
       actor (Duane Jones) in its lead role. Stark, haunting, and
       more relevant than ever, Night of the Living Dead is back"
